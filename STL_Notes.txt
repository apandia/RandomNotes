Unordered Container:
====================
unordered containers internally use a hash-table like structure.
Unordered Containers have an average complexity of O(1) for insert, search, delete

Ordered containers:
==================
ordered containers (maps, multimaps, sets) use a tree like  structure.
ordered containers have it as O(LogN) where N is the number of entries in the container.

Unordered Map vs Map?
===================== 
Map operates in O(LogN) time where as Unordered Map is O(1) on average.
Map keeps the data sorted, where unordered map keeps it in random order (due to separate chaining)
Map uses a balanced tree like data structure, whereas Unordered Map implements a hash-table with separate chaining.
 
So if the problem requires you to store key-value pairs in sorted order then use map, otherwise unordered map is better.


Multimaps & Unordered Multimaps:
=================================
We also have containers like Multimap, which are useful when there are multiple keys with equivalent value.

Sets & Unordered Sets:
======================
Sets are little different from hashtables, they don't store key-value pairs but can store keys in a sorted order.
Unordered Sets are faster and work in O(1) time on average. If sorting is not a requirement, then use Unordered Sets.
